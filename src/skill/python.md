- I possess extensive experience in programming languages, totaling over 5 years, with a specialized focus on Python for
  more than 2 years. My proficiency in Python extends across various domains, including web development, serverless
  computing, and data engineering.

- I have utilized Python to build robust APIs primarily using frameworks such as Flask, Django, FastAPI, and Chalice.
  These APIs have been instrumental in facilitating seamless communication between different components of complex
  systems, enabling efficient data transfer and processing.

- Additionally, I have leveraged Python to develop serverless functions on AWS Lambda, allowing for scalable and
  cost-effective execution of code in response to events. Moreover, I have utilized Python for building ETL (Extract,
  Transform, Load) functions within the delta live table environment of Databricks, enabling streamlined data processing
  and integration within data pipelines.

- Beyond traditional web development and data engineering, I have utilized Python for various tasks such as performance
  testing scripts and data generation utilities. These scripts have been instrumental in ensuring the reliability and
  efficiency of applications, as well as in generating synthetic data for testing and development purposes.

- Overall, my proficiency in Python spans a wide range of applications, from web development to serverless computing and
  data engineering, enabling me to deliver scalable, efficient, and reliable solutions across diverse projects and
  domains.
