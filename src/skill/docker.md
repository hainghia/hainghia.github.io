- In addition to my expertise in backend development, I also possess strong skills in DevOps, with a particular focus on
Docker containerization.

- I utilize Docker extensively to streamline the development process by setting up consistent and reproducible
environments locally. This approach ensures that the code I write functions seamlessly across different environments,
from development to production.

- Moreover, I leverage Docker for deploying my applications onto the AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) infrastructure.
By containerizing my applications with Docker, I can easily manage and scale them within the AWS cloud environment,
optimizing resource utilization and enhancing deployment efficiency.

- Furthermore, I am actively enhancing my knowledge of Kubernetes (K8s), a powerful orchestration tool for managing
containerized applications. By expanding my skills in Kubernetes, I aim to further optimize the deployment and
management of containerized applications, particularly in complex and dynamic environments.

- Overall, my proficiency in Docker enables me to efficiently manage the entire software development lifecycle, from local
development to deployment in cloud environments. Additionally, my commitment to continuous learning ensures that I stay
updated with the latest advancements in containerization technologies, such as Kubernetes, to further enhance my
capabilities in DevOps practices.
