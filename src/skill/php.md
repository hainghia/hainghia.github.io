- With over 5 years of experience working with multiple programming languages, including over 4 years of dedicated
  experience with PHP, I bring a wealth of expertise to Python development.

- Initially, my focus was primarily on PHP, where I spent considerable time building websites on CMS platforms like
  WordPress. This experience provided me with a strong foundation in web development and content management systems.

- As my career progressed, I transitioned to utilizing PHP within the Laravel framework, where I honed my skills in
  building robust APIs for server-side applications. Additionally, I expanded my usage of PHP to encompass e-commerce
  projects, leveraging Laravel's powerful features to develop scalable and secure online platforms.

- In recent years, I have ventured into Python development, drawing upon my extensive experience in PHP to excel in
  Python-based projects. While my background in PHP laid the groundwork for web development, Python has enabled me to
  broaden my skill set and tackle diverse challenges in areas such as data engineering, automation, and machine
  learning.

Overall, my proficiency in Python, coupled with my solid foundation in PHP, positions me as a versatile and adaptable
developer capable of delivering high-quality solutions across a spectrum of projects and domains.
